{"query":"What is Responsible AI","context":"Responsible AI involves creating and implementing artificial intelligence systems in a way that ensures they are ethical, transparent, accountable, and in line with societal values. This practice includes identifying and mitigating any potential negative impacts of AI systems while maximizing their benefits. At Microsoft, the concept of Responsible AI by Design is integrated from the early planning stages of any AI system and continues throughout its lifecycle to ensure adherence to evolving laws and regulations governing AI technologies.","ground_truth":"Responsible AI refers to the practice of designing, developing, and deploying artificial intelligence systems in a manner that ensures they are ethical, transparent, accountable, and aligned with societal values.

But AI systems developed without careful consideration can have unintended consequences. To secure AI system benefits and identify and mitigate any negative impacts, designing for Responsible AI should begin early in the planning of any AI system and continue throughout the system’s lifecycle . Toward this objective we have developed the Responsible AI Standard, the aim of which i s to guide Responsible AI by Design at Microsoft and centralize the practices that are necessary for compliance with emerging laws and regulations that govern AI technologies .  The Structure of the Standard The Responsible AI Standard comprises General Requirements , which must be followed for all AI systems, and Specific Requirements for Facial Recognition , which apply only to AI systems that use facial recognition technology. The General Requirements establish 14 Goals that flow from four of our AI principles : Accountability, Transparency, Fairness, and Reliability & Safety. The remaining two AI principles — Privacy & Security, and Inclusiveness — are governed by existing standards and policies (the Microsoft Privacy Standard, the Microsoft Security Policy, and the Microsoft Accessibility Standards).  Each Goal in the Standard is composed of requirements – concrete steps for teams to follow to build AI systems in accordance with the Microsoft AI principles. Many of the requirements are intended to mitigate the potential harms of AI systems in addition t o upholding our values. Compliance with the Standard is measured by the completion of all the steps for the Goals that apply to a system. Some requirements are accompanied by recommended tools and practices to help teams reach compliance, but many additio nal tools and practices will be needed as we grow in this nascent domain.
